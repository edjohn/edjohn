# Introduction
My name is Edward, and I am a recent computer science graduate from UC Davis. My passion lies in software engineering and entrepreneurship. 

My most significant work has been done for clients, which I cannot disclose publicly here but can provide upon request. As for everything else, you can find here!

I also happen to enjoy teaching software engineering to others. You can find some of my related notes on that on my Notion page [here](https://www.notion.so/Docs-d0a7a9049b5949f9924693a110d79158).
