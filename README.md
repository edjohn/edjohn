# Introduction
My name is Edward, and I am a recent computer science graduate from UC Davis. My passion lies in software engineering and entrepreneurship. 

My most significant work has been done for clients, which I cannot disclose publicly here but can provide upon request.

I also happen to train novice developers on software engineering topics. You can find some of my related notes on that on my Notion page [here](https://www.notion.so/Docs-d0a7a9049b5949f9924693a110d79158).

# Current Work
I am currently working on bringing a social app startup idea to life. Sign up for updates on that here: https://wavesocial.framer.ai/

I'm also currently running an agency that creates full-stack websites for startups. Reach out at contact@elevate-web.net if you're interested in an affordable yet aesthetic modern website!
